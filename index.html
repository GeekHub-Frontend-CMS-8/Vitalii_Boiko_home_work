            What is it?
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ve probably forgotten the Vauxhall Meriva. Most had. Small MPVs used to be a thing, but buyers deserted them for the new crop of small SUV-crossovers. Even if those people want a crossover, an MPV might still actually be a whole lot more use to them. They want rugged looks, but they need space and versatility and fuel economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the Crossland X is, in short, a mini MPV disguised as a crossover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of the normal MPV snowplough front end, it wears the mask of an SUV. Check the high, bluff grille and lights, and a relatively flat bonnet, with a faux bash plate underneath. The sweep of the two-tone roof at the rear aims to varnish over an MPV’s fishbowl glassiness.
            </p>
            <p>
            But it doesn’t take much to penetrate the subterfuge. It still has an MPV’s pudgy boxiness. It’s a bulky-bodied thing on relatively small wheels, without much ground clearance. There’s no four-wheel-drive option.
            </p>
            <p>
            The priority is cabin space and family-friendliness, fitted into a town-friendly length that’s 16cm shorter than an Astra’s. Adventurism is so far down the list as to have more or less dropped off the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                BTW we’re not slagging off Vauxhall’s strategy here. If you want 4x4 drive and high ground clearance and bigger towing-capable engines, they’ll happily sell you a Mokka X instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Crossland X is actually built on an updated version of the Peugeot 2008’s underpinnings and has Peugeot-Citroen-DS engines. It’s a joint-venture with the French company, and the other half of that venture is the Citroen C3 Aircross, due a month or two later. The C3 Aircross, just like the Crossland X, is a pseudo-crossover designed to replace an MPV – in that case the C3 Picasso.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even though the Crossland X shares genetics with a French car, it’s no mere badge-engineering job. It looks like a Vauxhall on the outside, and most of the visible interior parts are familiar Vauxhall stuff. It also drives like some Vauxhall (if not the best of them, unfortunately).
